# Introduction

The 3W Community is gradually expanding and is made up of independent professionals and representatives of research institutions, startups, companies and oil operators from different countries.

The following sections provide more information about this community.

# Citations

The 3W Dataset was useful and is cited by the works listed [here](../LISTS_OF_CITATIONS.md). These are basically papers, final graduation projects, master's degree dissertations, and doctoral theses. In general, these works are carried out by representatives of institutions.




## Progress Over the Years

The chart below shows the cumulative number of works citing the 3W Dataset since 2019, highlighting the growing academic and institutional engagement over the years. This steady increase demonstrates the dataset's relevance across different types of research and institutions worldwide.
