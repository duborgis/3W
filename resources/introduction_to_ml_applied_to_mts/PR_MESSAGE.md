# Introduction to ML applied to Multivariate Time Series - Initial Implementation

## Summary
Initial educational material for machine learning applied to multivariate time series using the 3W Dataset. This provides introductory content for courses and exploration of industrial fault detection in oil well operations.

## Content Added
- **5 Jupyter Notebooks**: Complete pipeline from data preprocessing to advanced analysis
- **Modular Python Utilities**: Centralized functions in `src/` for reusable components  
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: README with data contracts and pipeline architecture
- **Configurable Structure**: All parameters centralized for easy customization

## Technical Structure
- **Notebook 1**: Data treatment and preprocessing for time series
- **Notebook 2**: Visualization and dimensionality reduction techniques
- **Notebook 3**: Supervised learning for fault classification
- **Notebook 4**: Unsupervised learning for anomaly detection
- **Notebook 5**: Clustering methods for pattern discovery

## Status
This is **introductory material** designed for educational purposes. The implementation:
- âœ… Provides working end-to-end pipeline for MTS analysis
- âœ… Includes comprehensive documentation and examples
- âœ… Demonstrates key ML concepts applied to industrial data
- ðŸ”„ Will be further refined based on usage and feedback

## Notes
- All configurations are examples and fully customizable
- Focused on 2-sensor analysis for workshop time constraints
- Black code formatting applied to all Python files
- Ready for educational use and community contributions

**Open to suggestions and collaborative improvements.**
